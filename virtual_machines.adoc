= Virtual Machines

== Hardware

Velocity Micro Workstation
- AMD EPYC 7401P
- 125 GiB RAM
- 1x 480 GiB Intel Optane NVMe drive
- 2x Seagate 2TB Hard Drives

== Software

- ProxmoxVE
- vblade, aoe-tools

== Use
- Open Kubernetes Distrobution VM's
- Assorted, specific purpose VM's

== Storage

- ISO: Block device, via iSCI to QNAP
- VM: virtual block device, presented by ATAoE, managed as an LVM; multipathing is supported

== Capacity
=== Storage
All storage in the cluster is limited to 1 TiB to keep backups manageable.

=== vCPU
CPU threads will not be over-provisioned by more than 2x.

== Network

- Public: The current /24 (external interface)
- Private: 10.200.0.0/16 (vm-to-vm)
- Storage: 192.168.127.0/24 (external interface)

== Backup Policy
Snapshots of VM's will be taken every 3 hours and pruned as follows:
- Keep the last 6 hours
- Keep the last 7 days
- Keep the last 5 weeks
- Keep the last 12 months
- Keep the last 10 years

The overlap is purposely built-in.

All other backup tasks are handled on the TrueNAS array.
