= Storage

NOTE: Previous version of this document are radically different.  I've opted to go back to basics and choose simplicity as a primary design contstraint.

== Requirements

* A virtual machine with the storage bus pass through to the VM
* 5 disks of 4TB or larger, 7200 RPM
* Btrfs


== Storage Exposure

Storage will be exposed to other VM's via iSCSI.
It is up to the initiator VM to solve its own problems regarding files, and further exposing its shares via NFS
