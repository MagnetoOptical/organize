= Storage

NOTE: Previous version of this document are radically different.  I've opted to go back to basics and choose simplicity as a primary design contstraint.

== Requirements

* A virtual machine with the storage bus pass through to the VM
* 5 disks of 4TB or larger, 7200 RPM
* Btrfs


== Storage Exposure

Storage will be exposed to other VM's via NFS and iSCSI, and in select cases CIFS.  Excluding the backup server, all exposed storage is on the NAS.  Even if it looks like it's on another host, the presentation is really coming from the NAS (e.g. CIFS share for paperless-ngx)
