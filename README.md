# organize
Description: Space for me to record my effort to get more organized (with automation!)

## What is This?
Right now it's just a place where I'm keeping track of ideas about orgizing my mind and my work.  ADHD is hard.  Aging with ADHD is the first circle of hell.  I'm taking each moment of clarity to create a roadmap for implementing visual queues and documentaiton of my important work.

## Some Ideas
As far as I can tell, if I'm going to continue to thrive (survive?) in the tech space there are some essential things that need to be squared away.  To me, they seem to be:

* Hardware requirements
* Storage
* Virtual machines
* Containerized services


##### Some thoughts about the above...
I figure each component should be very Unixy.  In other words, it does its one thing and exposes an API which can be used to present all the data in a single pain of glass, hopefully allows for monitoring (alerts and such) and modifying the content and state of work as well.
