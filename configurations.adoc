= Configurations

== Host Configuration

I'm torn on this one.  I know Ansible pretty well, but it's not stateful and therefore verbose.  This is annoying.
Reasonable options seem to be:

* Ansible
* Saltstack


== Service Configuration

Terraform is the obvious winner here.  There's providers for Rancher/Kubernetes, and XCP-ng.  Nothing more to say.
