== Workstation


== OS

This is a ideological decision with broad implications and broad tolerances.  Generally, the preference is a flavor of GNU/Linux.
Where practical to choose, a Debian derivative is superior for my sensibilities.  

That said, I do see the value in NIX and Guix (though I loathe the syntax of the latter).  Qubes is also of interest, but being aesthetically driven (it will be my downfall, I'm sure), it holds little weight in my mind.


== Desktop Environment or Window Manager

COSMIC or Plasma Desktop.  If the latter, Latte Dock must be present--it's configuration should be stored in dotfiles.
